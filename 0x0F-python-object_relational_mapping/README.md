This might look a little odd. The first thing you should know is, fetch_row() takes some additional parameters. The first one is, how many rows (maxrows) should be returned. By default, it returns one row. It may return fewer rows than you asked for, but never more. If you set maxrows=0, it returns all rows of the result set. If you ever get an empty tuple back, you ran out of rows.

The second parameter (how) tells it how the row should be represented. By default, it is zero which means, return as a tuple. how=1 means, return it as a dictionary, where the keys are the column names, or table.column if there are two columns with the same name (say, from a join). how=2 means the same as how=1 except that the keys are always table.column; this is for compatibility with the old Mysqldb module.

OK, so why did we get a 1-tuple with a tuple inside? Because we implicitly asked for one row, since we didnâ€™t specify maxrows.

The other oddity is: Assuming these are numeric columns, why are they returned as strings? Because MySQL returns all data as strings and expects you to convert it yourself. This would be a real pain in the ass, but in fact, MySQLdb._mysql can do this for you. (And MySQLdb does do this for you.) To have automatic type conversion done, you need to create a type converter dictionary, and pass this to connect() as the conv keyword parameter.
